## Introduction
Hello! I'm Jeremy. I'm a __Computer Programmer__ at [NovaXpress](https://novaxpress.ca).

I enjoy writting code for all sorts of projects from system drivers to browser extensions! You should check out some of the projects I'm most proud of pinned below!

### Discovering code.
I first started programming in Java in 2014 to add features to my Minecraft server. From there, around 2017 I left Minecraft development behind me in favour of game development using [AWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit) (Check out my [Datum](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Datum), [Fall](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Fall), [Electro](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Electro) and [Flail](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Flail/tree/main) AWT projects!). I found that I enjoyed the design work for applications and libraries, and many libraries I wrote (notable ones being [J2DGE](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/J2DGE), [Networking](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Networking) and [JavaBinarySerialization](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/JavaBinarySerialization))!

### Reinventing the wheel! ...as an oval.
I had a lot of fun with Java and AWT, but hit the limitations of software rendering pretty quickly. I also learned that I liked the low level stuff. The small things would bother me, and I always found myself writting my own versions of libraries or wrappers so that I wouldn't have to interface directly with somebody else's code. This started my meddling with OpenGL and hardware accelerated graphics! I started with [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/), writting an [engine in Java](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/3D-Renderer.git) based on it, quickly moving on, [playing around with libGDX](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Dilexit) and seeing what all the fuss was about composition over inheritance with an ECS and finally moving to C++ where I wrote a much sought after [deer renderer](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/Deer-Renderer.git)!

### Being productive.
Eventually I started working as a web developer for a delivery company (Throughout my journey with Java and C++ I also dabbled in some web development with a multitude of pretty dull projects, [Geoline](https://github.com/JeremyBankes/geoline) being the only one I really polished. They ended up getting me this job). I worked for about 2 years and moved out to a rural town in Nova Scotia, where I now spend a lot of time hiking, cycling and working in my wood shop!
